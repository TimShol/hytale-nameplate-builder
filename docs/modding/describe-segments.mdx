title: Describe Segments
description: Register UI metadata so players can see and manage your segments.
---

In your plugin's `setup()` method, call `NameplateAPI.describe()` to tell the UI about each segment you plan to use.

## What `describe()` Does

It registers **UI metadata only**. It does NOT create any ECS components or affect entities. It tells the NameplateBuilder UI:

> "My mod has a segment called `health`, show it as `Health Bar`, it's for all entities, and it looks like `67/67`."

Describing is **optional but highly recommended**. Without it, the UI shows the raw segment ID instead of a display name.

## The Three Overloads

### 1. Name Only

```java
// Shows up as "Custom Tag" with target [All] and no example preview.
// Good for segments where the value is unpredictable.
NameplateAPI.describe(this, "custom-tag", "Custom Tag");
```

### 2. Name + Target

```java
// The SegmentTarget shows as a tag in the UI, e.g. "by YourMod [NPCs]".
// This is purely a UI hint — it does NOT restrict which entities you
// can register the segment on at runtime.
NameplateAPI.describe(this, "faction", "Faction", SegmentTarget.NPCS);
```

### 3. Name + Target + Example (Recommended)

```java
// The example text is shown as a preview in the UI so players can see
// what the segment looks like before enabling it.
NameplateAPI.describe(this, "health", "Health Bar",
        SegmentTarget.ALL, "67/67");

NameplateAPI.describe(this, "guild", "Guild Tag",
        SegmentTarget.PLAYERS, "[Warriors]");

NameplateAPI.describe(this, "tier", "Elite Tier",
        SegmentTarget.NPCS, "[Elite]");

NameplateAPI.describe(this, "level", "Level",
        SegmentTarget.ALL, "Lv. 42");
```

## SegmentTarget Values

| Target | UI Tag | Use When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SegmentTarget.ALL` | `[All]` | The segment applies to any entity (players, NPCs, etc.) |
| `SegmentTarget.PLAYERS` | `[Players]` | The segment only makes sense on players (e.g. guild tag, rank) |
| `SegmentTarget.NPCS` | `[NPCs]` | The segment only makes sense on NPCs (e.g. faction, mood, bounty) |

The target is **only a UI hint**. You can still register a `PLAYERS`-targeted segment on an NPC at runtime. The UI just uses it to help players understand what each segment is for.

## When to Call `describe()`

Always call `describe()` in your plugin's `setup()` method, **before** registering any tick systems. This ensures the UI metadata is available as soon as players open `/npb`.

```java
@Override
protected void setup() {
    // Describe first
    NameplateAPI.describe(this, "health", "Health Bar",
            SegmentTarget.ALL, "67/67");

    // Then register systems
    getEntityStoreRegistry().registerSystem(
        new MySystem(NameplateAPI.getComponentType()));
}
```
