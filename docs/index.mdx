description: NameplateBuilder — a server-side nameplate aggregator for Hytale.
---

**NameplateBuilder** solves a core problem for Hytale modders and players: when multiple mods want to display information above entities, they conflict over the single `Nameplate` component. NameplateBuilder acts as a central aggregator — each mod registers named segments, and the system composites them into one nameplate per entity, per viewer, every tick.

Players get a full UI to customize what they see. Admins get server-wide controls. Modders get a simple API.

## What It Does

* **Multi-mod aggregation** — Any number of mods register segments (health, guild tag, tier, title) and NameplateBuilder composites them into a single nameplate per entity
* **Player customization** — Players open `/npb` to pick segments, reorder them, choose display formats, set separators, and configure prefix/suffix wrapping
* **Admin controls** — Force segments on all players, disable segments globally, set a server display name
* **Built-in segments** — Ships with Player Name, Health, Stamina, and Mana out of the box
* **Zero-conflict** — Death cleanup, persistent preferences, view-cone filtering, and hologram offset rendering are all handled automatically
