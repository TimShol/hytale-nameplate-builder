## Players

### How do I open the nameplate editor?

Type `/npb` in chat (aliases: `/nameplatebuilder`, `/nameplateui`).

### Why does an entity show "Type /npb to customize"?

You have no segments enabled. Open `/npb`, go to the NPCs or Players tab, and add segments from the Available Blocks section.

### Why can't I remove a segment from my chain?

That segment has been marked as **required** by a server admin. Required segments appear with a yellow-tinted background and are always displayed. You can still reorder them.

### Why don't I see some segments in Available Blocks?

A server admin may have **disabled** those segments. Check the Disabled tab under NAMEPLATES to see what's been turned off.

### How do I change the health display format?

Click the **Format** button on the Health segment in your chain. Select a variant (Current/Max, Percentage, or Bar), optionally set prefix/suffix text, then click **Confirm** and **Save**.

### How do I hide nameplates entirely?

Open `/npb`, go to the General tab, and toggle **Enable Nameplates** off.

### What does the offset setting do?

It moves the nameplate vertically above (or below) the entity. A value of `1.0` moves it one block higher. Uses invisible anchor entities for the floating effect.

## Server Admins

### How do I force a segment to always show?

Open `/npb`, go to the **Required** tab under ADMIN, and move the segment from the Available column to the Required column using the `>` button. Click **Save**.

### How do I disable a segment globally?

Open `/npb`, go to the **Disabled** tab under ADMIN, and move the segment to the Disabled column. Click **Save**.

### Can I both require and disable a segment?

No. A segment cannot be both required and disabled. Marking one automatically removes the other.

### How do I change the server name in the welcome message?

Open `/npb`, go to the **Settings** tab under ADMIN, type the name, and click **Save**.

### Where is the config stored?

In your save folder: `%APPDATA%/Hytale/UserData/Saves/<save>/mods/NameplateBuilder/`. See [Persistence](/reference/persistence) for file format details.

## Mod Developers

### Why am I getting `NameplateNotInitializedException`?

Your mod is calling the API before NameplateBuilder has loaded. Add the manifest dependency:

```json
{
  "Dependencies": {
    "Frotty27:NameplateBuilder": "*"
  }
}
```

### Why does `store.addComponent()` throw inside my tick system?

The store is locked for structural changes during tick processing. Use `commandBuffer.putComponent()` instead. See [Tick Systems](/modding/tick-systems) for the correct pattern.

### Do I need to clean up nameplates when entities die?

No. NameplateBuilder automatically clears nameplates on death. See [Advanced](/modding/advanced#cleanup-and-unregistering).

### Do I need to call `undescribe()` when my plugin shuts down?

No. NameplateBuilder automatically removes all segment descriptions when your plugin unloads.

### Can two mods use the same segment ID?

Yes. Segment IDs are scoped to your plugin. Two mods can both register a `"health"` segment without conflict — they are tracked as separate entries internally using `pluginId:segmentId`.

### How do I update segment text efficiently?

Call `data.setText()` — it's a `HashMap.put()` internally. Calling it every tick is safe and cheap. The aggregator reads the latest value when it composites the nameplate.

### Can I register a PLAYERS-targeted segment on an NPC?

Yes. The `SegmentTarget` is a UI hint only. You can register any segment on any entity at runtime regardless of the target.
