title: Segment Editor
description: Add, remove, reorder, and customize nameplate segments.
---

The **NPCs** and **Players** tabs are the main editor views. Each one lets you build a segment chain for a specific entity type.

## Chain Section

The top of the editor shows your active **segment chain** — the ordered list of segments that will be composited into the nameplate. Each block in the chain shows:

* **Segment name** and author mod
* **Preview bar** — example output text for that segment
* **Move left/right buttons** — reorder the segment in the chain
* **Remove button** — take the segment out of the chain (not available for admin-required segments)
* **Format button** — opens the [format popup](/player-guide/format-popup) when the segment has multiple display variants. Shows "Formatted" in green when a non-default variant is selected

### Required Segments

Segments marked as required by a server admin appear with a **yellow-tinted** background. They are always included in the nameplate output and cannot be removed from the chain. You can still reorder them.

## Separators

Each segment in the chain has its own separator to the next segment. Click the separator text between two blocks to edit it. Common separators include ` - `, ` | `, and ` `. An empty separator means the segments run together without spacing.

## Preview

Below the chain, a **live preview** bar shows the composited nameplate text using your current chain, separators, format selections, and prefix/suffix wrapping. The preview updates in real time as you make changes. Long text is truncated with an ellipsis.

## Available Blocks

Below the preview, all registered segments that are **not** in your chain are displayed as a grid. Each block shows:

* **Segment name** and author mod
* **Target tag** — `[All]`, `[Players]`, or `[NPCs]` indicating which entity types the segment is designed for
* **Example preview** — sample output text (if the mod provided one)
* **Add button** — adds the segment to the end of your chain

Built-in segments (Health, Player Name, Stamina, Mana) appear with a warm-purple tint to distinguish them from mod-provided segments.

### Search & Pagination

A search field at the top of the Available Blocks section lets you filter by name. Pagination buttons appear when there are more blocks than fit on one page.

## Clear All & Save

* **Clear All** — removes all segments from the chain (except admin-required ones)
* **Save** — persists your current chain, separators, and format selections to disk

## Disabled Tab

Under the NAMEPLATES section, the **Disabled** tab shows a read-only 4x4 grid of all admin-disabled segments. These segments are hidden from all players and cannot be added to chains. The blocks appear with red-tinted backgrounds and no action buttons. Pagination is available when there are more than 16 disabled segments.
