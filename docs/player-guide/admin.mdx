title: Admin Panel
description: Server-wide segment controls and configuration.
---

The **ADMIN** section in the sidebar is only visible to players with the `nameplatebuilder.admin` permission. It contains three sub-tabs: **Required**, **Disabled**, and **Settings**.

## Required Sub-Tab

Force specific segments to always display for all players.

The panel uses a **two-column layout** with a vertical divider:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Available** (left) | Segments not currently required. Green-tinted blocks with a `>` button to move to Required. Excludes disabled segments. |
| **Required** (right) | Segments forced on all players. Yellow-tinted blocks with a `<` button to move back to Available. |

### How Required Segments Work

* Required segments are **always displayed** in the nameplate output for all players
* They are **always included** in every player's chain
* Players can still **reorder** required segments within their chain
* Players **cannot remove** required segments from their chain
* A segment **cannot be both** required and disabled — marking one removes the other

Each column has independent pagination (7 rows per page). Use **Save** to persist changes and **Reset** to revert.

## Disabled Sub-Tab

Hide specific segments from all players entirely.

Same two-column layout, using red-tinted blocks and headers:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Available** (left) | Segments not currently disabled. Green-tinted blocks with a `>` button to move to Disabled. Excludes required segments. |
| **Disabled** (right) | Segments hidden from all players. Red-tinted blocks with a `<` button to move back. |

### How Disabled Segments Work

* Disabled segments are **excluded** from all player chains
* They are **filtered out** of available-block lists in the editor
* They are **skipped** by the aggregator — never shown in nameplates
* Players can see which segments are disabled via the [Disabled tab](/player-guide/editor#disabled-tab) under NAMEPLATES
* When **all segments are disabled**, nameplates are blanked globally and the join message switches to the red "disabled" variant

Each column has independent pagination (7 rows per page). Use **Save** to persist changes and **Reset** to revert.

## Settings Sub-Tab

### Server Name

A text field for the display name shown in the join welcome message. The name appears inside brackets:

```
[YourServerName] - Use /npb to customize your nameplates.
```

Defaults to "NameplateBuilder" if left blank. Use **Save** to persist and **Reset** to revert.

## Persistence

All admin configuration is stored in `admin_config.txt` in the mod's data folder. The format uses pipe-delimited lines:

| Prefix | Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `S` | `S\|serverName` | Server display name |
| `R` | `R\|pluginId\|segmentId` | Required segment |
| `D` | `D\|pluginId\|segmentId` | Disabled segment |

Lines starting with `#` are comments. Blank lines are ignored.
