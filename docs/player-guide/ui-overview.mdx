description: Navigate the NameplateBuilder player interface.
---

Open the editor with `/npb` (aliases: `/nameplatebuilder`, `/nameplateui`). The UI features a sidebar on the left with three sections.

## Sidebar Layout

| Section | Tab | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GENERAL** | Settings | Master enable/disable, look-at toggle, vertical offset, welcome message toggle |
| **NAMEPLATES** | NPCs | Segment chain editor for NPC nameplates |
| | Players | Segment chain editor for player nameplates |
| | Disabled | Read-only view of all admin-disabled segments |
| **ADMIN** | Required | Required segments panel (admin only) |
| | Disabled | Disabled segments panel (admin only) |
| | Settings | Server name configuration (admin only) |

The **ADMIN** section is only visible to players with the `nameplatebuilder.admin` permission.

## How Nameplates Work

Each player has their own **segment chain** — an ordered list of segments that get composited into the nameplate string. The chain determines what appears above entities and in what order.

For example, if a player's NPC chain is `[Health Bar, Guild Tag, Elite Tier]` with ` - ` separators, entities would show:

```
42/67 - [Warriors] - [Elite]
```

Every installed mod can contribute segments. Players pick the ones they want, order them however they like, and choose display formats per segment.

## Built-in Segments

NameplateBuilder ships with four built-in segments, shown with a warm-purple tint in the UI:

| Segment | Variants | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Player Name** | Name, Anonymized | Players |
| **Health** | Current/Max, Percentage, Bar | All |
| **Stamina** | Current/Max, Percentage, Bar | All |
| **Mana** | Current/Max, Percentage, Bar | All |

## Empty State

When no segments are enabled, entities display the hint text:

```
Type /npb to customize
```

This hint appears instead of the raw entity ID, letting new players know the system exists.
