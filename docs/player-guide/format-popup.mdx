title: Format Popup
description: Choose display formats, prefix/suffix wrapping, and bar styles.

When a segment has multiple display formats (variants), clicking the **Format** button on a chain block opens the format popup.

## Variant Selection

The top of the popup lists all available display variants for that segment. For example, Health might offer:

| Variant | Example Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current/Max** (default) | `42/67` |
| **Percentage** | `63%` |
| **Bar** | `\|\|\|\|\|\|------` |

Click a variant to select it. The selected variant is highlighted in green. The chain preview updates in real time to show the new format.

## Prefix & Suffix

Below the variant list, two text fields let you wrap the segment output:

* **Before** (prefix) — text prepended to the segment value, e.g. `HP: [`
* **After** (suffix) — text appended to the segment value, e.g. `]`

With the above settings and the Current/Max variant, the output would be: `HP: [42/67]`

## Bar Style

This section is only visible when the selected variant is a **Bar** type. It contains:

* **Empty** — the character used for unfilled segments of the bar. Defaults to `-`

For example, with `Empty: .` the bar would render as `||||||......` instead of `||||||------`.

## Confirm / Cancel

Format changes are previewed live in the chain but are **not saved** until you click **Confirm**. Click **Cancel** to discard changes and revert to the previous format settings.

After confirming, remember to click **Save** in the main editor to persist your changes to disk.
