description: Get NameplateBuilder running on your Hytale server.
---

## Requirements

* Java 25
* Hytale Server build-7 or later
* Gradle 9.2+ (only if building from source)

## Installing the Server Plugin

1. Download the NameplateBuilder server plugin JAR from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods)
2. Place the JAR in your server's `UserData/Mods` folder
3. Start the server — NameplateBuilder will generate its config files automatically
4. Players can now use `/npb` to open the customization UI

That's it. Built-in segments (Player Name, Health, Stamina, Mana) are available immediately.

## For Mod Developers

If you're building a mod that integrates with NameplateBuilder, you also need the **API jar**:

1. Download the NameplateBuilder API jar
2. Place it in your mod project's `libs/` folder
3. Add it as a `compileOnly` dependency in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly files('libs/NameplateBuilder-API-1.0.0.jar')
}
```

4. Add the manifest dependency so NameplateBuilder loads first:

```json
{
  "Dependencies": {
    "Frotty27:NameplateBuilder": "*"
  }
}
```

See the [Modding Quick Start](/modding/quick-start) for a complete integration walkthrough.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimShol/hytale-nameplate-builder.git
cd hytale-nameplate-builder
./gradlew build
```

This compiles all three modules (`nameplate-api`, `nameplate-server`, `nameplate-example-mod`), packages shadow JARs, and deploys them to your Hytale `UserData/Mods` folder.

To build individual modules:

```bash
./gradlew :nameplate-api:build
./gradlew :nameplate-server:build
./gradlew :nameplate-example-mod:build
```
