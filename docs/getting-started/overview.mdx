## The Problem

Hytale gives each entity a single `Nameplate` component. When multiple mods try to set it, they overwrite each other. NameplateBuilder fixes this by acting as a central aggregator — mods register named **segments**, and the system composites them into one nameplate string per entity, per viewer, every tick.

## Core Features

* **Multi-mod aggregation** — Any number of mods contribute segments. NameplateBuilder handles compositing, ordering, and per-viewer preferences
* **Built-in segments** — Player Name (with anonymize variant), Health, Stamina, and Mana (each with Current/Max, Percentage, and Bar variants). Built-in segments are shown with a distinct warm-purple tint in the UI
* **Death cleanup** — Nameplates are automatically cleared when an entity dies, instead of lingering through the death animation
* **Persistent preferences** — All player settings and admin config are saved to disk and survive server restarts

## Welcome Message

When a player joins, a coloured message is displayed:

* **Green** when nameplates are available — `[ServerName] - Use /npb to customize your nameplates.`
* **Red** when all segments are admin-disabled — `[ServerName] - Nameplates are disabled on this server.`

Players can toggle this off via General settings.

## Player Customization

Players open `/npb` (aliases: `/nameplatebuilder`, `/nameplateui`) to access a full UI with:

* **Per-player segment chains** — Add, remove, and reorder segments from all installed mods
* **Per-block separators** — Each segment can have its own separator to the next
* **Format variants** — Mods can register multiple display formats (e.g. health as `42/67`, `63%`, or `||||||------`)
* **Prefix/suffix wrapping** — Custom text to wrap segment output (e.g. `HP: [` and `]`)
* **Bar customization** — Change the empty-fill character in bar variants
* **Confirm/cancel workflow** — Format changes are previewed live but only saved on Confirm
* **Nameplate offset** — Configurable vertical offset using invisible anchor entities
* **View-cone filtering** — Optional "only show when looking at" mode (~25 degree cone, up to 30 blocks)
* **Live preview** — Real-time composited text preview in the editor

## Admin Controls

Admins with the `nameplatebuilder.admin` permission can:

* **Require segments** — Force specific segments to always display for all players. Required segments appear with a yellow tint and cannot be removed from chains
* **Disable segments** — Hide specific segments from all players entirely. A segment cannot be both required and disabled. When every segment is disabled, nameplates are blanked globally
* **Server name** — Set a custom display name for the join welcome message (defaults to "NameplateBuilder")

## Permissions

| Permission | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `nameplatebuilder.admin` | Grants access to the admin tabs (Required, Disabled, Settings) in the UI. Without this permission, the ADMIN section is hidden from the sidebar. |
